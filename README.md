# Stack, Spring 2016
This is a project for my Spring 2016 Data Structures and Algorithms class. It uses a generic stack to make stacks for strings and a custom date data type and gives normal options for stack operations. This was the first and easiest lab in the class, and my first time programming in Ada.

A complete description of the assignment is available in DSStackLabDescription.pdf

There were multiple options for different grades available, I chose the 'A' option, which basically incorporates all of the lower options and a little extra. The assignment was to create a generic stack using Ada generics, with recognition of overflow and underflow, and show the outcome of inputting the different data sets. The data types used were basic strings, and a custom date type.

generic_stack.ads is the specification for the generic stack.

generic_stack.adb is the actual implementation of the generic stack.

Lab1.adb is the main program.

DataSetA, B, and D are the inputs for the different data sets, while OutputA, B, D are the outputs from the respective data set files.
